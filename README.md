**Briefly explain what your code does and specify any inputs and outputs required.** 

This code scrapes multiple elements from multiple web pages of an online bookstore at once. 

INPUT: Starting by initiating an empty list that will hold our output "one_star_titles = []".
Iterating to get info from the first five pages "for n in range (1,6):".

OUTPUT: Running this code gives us our list "one_star_titles".
The script gives us a list of all of the books that only have one star rating, in the first 5 pages of the website.



**Any problems you encountered and how you debugged them.** 

One problem that I encountered had to do with while entering the input to hold the output. I referenced the code mentioned in the GitHub page to adjust the script accordingly to give me the desired output.



**Any interesting insights you gained from the tutorial.**

The most interesting insight that I gained from the tutorial involved creating another loop within the original loop to parse the books and select star rating one which scraped multiple elements from multiple web pages of the online bookstore at once.
